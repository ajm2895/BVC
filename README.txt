## Usage

DEPLOYMENT:
When you start the program two windows will open. One is labeled "Config" and it contains all the configuration settings for the "Countdown" window. The Countdown window was designed to be displayed on an external monitor for a presenter to look at while speaking. If you have an external monitor connected, ensure that your primary display is set to "extended desktop". click anywhere inside the Countdown window and press f11 on your keyboard. It will send the Countdown window to the second desktop with the resolution set to fullscreen. Press f11 again to exit full-screen.

When the "Config" window opens it will be set to "Timer", this can be switched to "Current Time" with the radio buttons located in the bottom right corner of the config window.  

SETUP:
In the hours, minutes, and seconds fields enter the total amount of time to count down and press the "Set" button. When you are ready for the timer to start, press the play button. When the countdown reaches zero, it will begin counting into overtime. 

Time can be added or subtracted from the countdown by using the +1/+5/+10/-1/-5/-10 buttons. 

When the countdown drops below five minutes ("0:04:59"), the color will be automatically changed to yellow and changed to red below one minute left ("0:00:59"). 

The default color for above five minutes is green. The color and font size can be changed by the drop down menu and entry field, respectively, located in the bottom right corner of the config window. 

A title and/or message can be displayed using the entry fields in the bottom right corner.

	          ">>" = Send to Screen

The title and message can be turned on or off using the check button in the bottom left corner. The title and message are not updated in real-time. When the check button is turned on, the title and message will display the current text inside the entry fields. To make changes while it is turned on, use the Send to Screen buttons. To remove both the tite and message, turn the check button off.

The "Clear" button will clear the title and message entry fields. The "Flash" button will make the message blink red once.
