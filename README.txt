BVC Production Timer
Version 2.0

				## Installation ##

Download and extract all contents of the zipped folder to your desired location. Create a shortcut and place it on the Desktop. 


			##  DEPLOYMENT & MORE OPTIONS:  ##

When you start the program two windows will open. One is labeled "Config" and it contains all the configuration settings for the "Countdown" window. The Countdown window was designed to be displayed on an external monitor for a presenter to look at while speaking. If you have an external monitor connected, ensure that your primary display is set to "extended desktop". Pressing the 'Fullscreen' button will send the Countdown window to the second desktop with the resolution set to fullscreen. Pressing the button a second time will exit fullscreen.

When the "Config" window opens it will be set to "Timer", this can be switched to "Current Time" with the radio buttons located in the bottom right of the config window.

By default, the timer will start to count into 'OVERTIME' when the countdown reaches '0:00:00'. This can be toggled using the checkbutton located under the options menu. 

To lock the timer use the checkbutton located under the options menu. This option will lock the config window preventing input, while still allowing the countdown to run.

Select an output resolution from the options provided (1024x720, 1280x720, 1920x1080) to match the resolution of your extended display. If none of the options provided are sufficient, the font can be changed by selecting the 'Advanced' option located under the options menu.

Select 'New Countdown' under the options menu to open a new countdown window. Only one countdown can be open at any given time. 

Select 'Reset All' under the options menu to return all settings to the original selection. 


				 ##  SETUP:  ##

In the hours, minutes, and seconds fields enter the total amount of time to count down and press the "Set" button. When you are ready for the timer to start, press the play button. 

Time can be added or subtracted from the countdown by using the +1/+5/+10/-1/-5/-10 buttons. 

By default, when the countdown drops below five minutes ("0:04:59"), the color will be automatically changed to yellow and changed to red below one minute left ("0:00:59"). The warning times are configurable using the entry boxes located under the preview in the config window. 

The default color for above five minutes is green. The color can be changed by the drop down menu located under the preview in the config window. 

A title and/or message can be displayed using the entry fields in the bottom left corner of the config window.

	          ">>" = Send to Screen

The title and message can be turned on or off using the check button in the bottom left corner. The title and message are not updated in real-time. When the check button is turned on, the title and message will display the current text inside the entry fields. To make changes while it is turned on, use the Send to Screen buttons. To remove both the tite and message, turn the check button off.

The "Clear" button will clear the title and message entry fields. The "Flash" button will make the message blink.
